This study explores the role of infrared (IR) data in enabling closed-loop predictive control for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). A Multi-Input, Multi-Output XGBoost Regressor was developed to combine pre-print settings with real-time high fidelity sensor data, allowing simultaneous prediction of multiple mechanical properties. Compared to a baseline Random Forest model, the XGBoost framework demonstrated stronger predictive accuracy and robustness across material performance metrics. A PID feedback simulation further confirmed the practical viability of this approach, showing that tensile strength could be consistently regulated through nozzle temperature adjustments, while elongation proved less responsive to the available controllable parameters. These findings suggest that IR data can be key factor for advancing adaptive control in FFF, further shifting the optimization process from a focus solely on geometry toward more reliable control of underlying mechanical properties.
